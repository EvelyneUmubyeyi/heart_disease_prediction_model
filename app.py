            Based on the information you provided, it appears that you may have some risk factors for heart diseases, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol levels, and a sedentary lifestyle. However, there are several things you can do to mitigate these risk factors and improve your heart health.

            Regular physical activity is essential for maintaining good cardiovascular health. Engaging in at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise most days of the week can help reduce the risk of developing heart diseases. This can include activities such as brisk walking, cycling, or swimming.

            Eating a balanced diet that is rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats can also help maintain good heart health. It is recommended to consume at least five servings of fruits and vegetables per day and to limit the intake of saturated and trans fats, sodium, and added sugars.

            It is also important to avoid smoking and limit alcohol consumption. Smoking is a significant risk factor for heart diseases, and reducing or quitting smoking can significantly improve heart health. Excessive alcohol consumption can also increase the risk of heart diseases, and it is recommended to limit intake to no more than 14 drinks per week if you are male or 7 drinks per week if you are female.

            Regular check-ups with a healthcare provider can also help monitor heart health and identify any potential risks or issues. It is recommended to have a cholesterol check at least once every five years and to discuss any concerns about blood pressure or diabetes with a healthcare provider.

            It is also important to prioritize rest and relaxation, as adequate sleep and stress management can significantly impact your health and well-being.

            Based on the responses you provided, it seems that you do not have any heart diseases. However, it is important to maintain a healthy lifestyle to prevent the development of heart diseases and maintain good health.

            Regular exercise, a balanced and nutritious diet, and sufficient rest are all essential components of a healthy lifestyle. Engaging in physical activity for at least 30 minutes a day can help strengthen your heart, lungs, and muscles, and reduce your risk of developing chronic conditions such as heart disease, obesity, and type 2 diabetes.

            Staying hydrated by drinking plenty of water and avoiding excessive alcohol consumption and smoking can also benefit your overall health. 

            Remember that making healthy choices can have long-term benefits for your physical and mental health.
