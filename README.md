# Heart Disease Prediction Project

Heart disease is increasingly becoming a major cause of death in the modern world, mainly due to unhealthy lifestyles. While it is advised by health professionals to go for a heart check-up every two to four years, there’s a big population who live with heart disease unknowingly. This is due to limited access to health care or simply because they don’t see any symptoms, leading to preventable deaths. There's a need for a more accessible, easy-to-use tech solution to help everyone freely get a heart disease diagnosis any time, for people to take preventative measures and get help sooner.
